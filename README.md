# Docker Environment for PHP 8.3, MySql, phpMyAdmin, Composer using Ubuntu 20

## This configuration tested in Ubuntu 22

Here I added Makefile to run commands easily. If you do not have make installed on your ubuntu machine then install it first.

## Commands

### sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

### sudo apt install -y make

### sudo apt install build-essential

then from parent folder type make command_name to run command
